## Abstract

Measuring glucose levels in bioprocesses is essential to ensure robust cultivations. By controlling the glucose level, the metabolism and therefore the cells’ products can be regulated. There are various glucose measurement methods e.g. High­performance liquid chromatography, chip based, enzyme based, but they almost all lack in either speed, price or accuracy.

With the ever increasing automation in the biotechnological field the challenges of testing a huge amount of samples arises and cannot be overcome with the existing methods. In addition, integration into liquid handling stations and other systems is usually only possible at great expense.

Alongside all other methods for glucose level determination we are exploring a concept for a potential fast, cheap and highly accurate at­line measurement system that is optimized for high throughout liquid handling stations. By building a chassis with a capillary and a sensor chamber, where the sensor will be located, it’s possible to measure a sample in about four minutes. The fluid is moved by a pressure difference caused by a pump. Though the “ANSI_SLAS_1-2004” Standard this device is universally applicable.

The system needs only a small volume, no supervision, but can deter­ mine the glucose concentration only very inaccurately at the moment. The search for a solution, revealed that there are a number of factors which could be responsible for the inaccuracy. There is a prediction method in place, that can potentially determine the glucose faster, once accuracy problems are solved. The data is saved automatically and the system is fully integrated into a liquid handling station, while being as small as a 96 well plate.

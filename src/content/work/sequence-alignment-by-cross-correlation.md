  My project, inspired by the paper "Sequence Alignment by Cross-Correlation," seeks to bridge the gap between theory and application. Using the cross-correlation algorithm, we offer a simple notebook for testing. Join us in exploring this technique in sequence alignment. The Notebook and details for applying it, can be found via the GitHub Link.
